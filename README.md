Supernova's translator task

## Getting Started
I used BLoC management for the task.
iOS haven't been tested (I don't eve either a mac or an iphone sadly), but there is no reason for it not to work :)

Before building run the following command lines:

- flutter pub get
- flutter pub run build_runner build
